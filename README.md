## Hello traveler, I'm Sean! 👋
I'm a Software Engineer with experience using JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, React, Ruby, Node.js, Flask, Amazon Web Services (EC2, Kinesis, Lambda, Dynamo, S3), AWS CDK, Terraform and Docker. 

## 🚀 Helios
Most recently, I've created Helios, an open-source platform designed to simplify the visualization and analysis of real-time event streams by exposing data for SQL querying. It's web app and automated deployment solution is catered to helping Amazon Kinesis users.

To learn more about the design trade-offs and architecture, you can view the [technical case-study here](https://helios-platform.github.io/).
